# GREEDY-BEST-FIRST-SEARCH
Greedy Best-First Search (GBFS) is a heuristic-based search algorithm that expands the node that appears to be the most promising, based on a given heuristic function.
Greedy Best First Search (GBFS) is a heuristic-based search algorithm that prioritizes exploring the node that appears to be closest to the goal, based solely on a given heuristic function. This approach enhances search efficiency but may not guarantee an optimal solution. GBFS is widely used in artificial intelligence, robotics, and pathfinding applications due to its fast decision-making capabilities. 

However, its reliance on heuristics can lead to suboptimal paths and local minima.

GBFS works by selecting the node with the lowest heuristic value at each step, without considering the cost of reaching that node. This makes it faster than other informed search algorithms like A* but can result in inefficiencies such as getting stuck in loops or local optima. Despite these limitations, GBFS remains useful in scenarios where quick approximations are required, and computational resources are limited. Variations of GBFS are commonly employed in practical applications like GPS navigation, game AI, and real-time decision-making systems.

Future improvements in GBFS involve integrating adaptive heuristics, hybrid search methods, and optimization techniques to mitigate its weaknesses and improve pathfinding accuracy while maintaining its speed advantages.
